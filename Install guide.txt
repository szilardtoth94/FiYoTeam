Database:
	1. Downlaod and install the MySQL server and the MySQL WorkBench
	2. After installation run the SQL script from the "db_dump" folder to create the database schema and the tables.

Frontend:
	1. Download and install the NodeJs 
	2. After installation go to the "fiyoteam-frontend" folder, open a command-prompt and type "npm-install" - for downloading and installing the necesarry dependencies.
	3. To start the frondend project just open a new cmd window, and type npm start. This will open the project in a new browser tab.

Backend:
	In order to start the Backend, we need 4 important things:
		1. JDK - download and install the JDK
		2. Maven: 
			a.) download and install the latest stable version of maven
			b.) unzip the files in a folder choosen by ourselves
			c.) add to Path (Environment Variables) the /bin folder of the maven
			d.) test if the installation was successful by the "mvn â€“version" command
		3. Eclipse EE IDE - download and install the eclipse ide's EE version
		4. Download and configure Tomcat (version 8.5) in Eclipse. Here is a little tutorial how to do that: http://crunchify.com/step-by-step-guide-to-setup-and-install-apache-tomcat-server-in-eclipse-development-environment-ide/

	If everything is installed, and everything works we have to do the following steps in order to start the server:
		1. Go to the "fiyoteam-backend" folder, open a cmd, and type mvn intall
		2. After mvn install finished, open the Eclipse IDE and import the backend project.
		3. Right click on the project -> Maven -> Update project
		4. Now we have to add the project to the Tomcat server
			a.) If the Servers view is not shown in Eclipse:  Window -> Show View -> Other... and then type Servers in the filter
			b.) After the Servers view is shown in Tomcat's window, Richt click on the Tomcat, and add for it our backend project.
			c.) Now time to start the server.


 Enjoy the project! :)
